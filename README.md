### Project Summary
In this project I pulled all my data engineering skills together by creating a website:

1. Used Python Django package to create an application that retrives GIF files from Giphy AIP based on user input keyword.

2. Used IMDB API that retrieves information of the Top 250 classic movies and render the content on my website.   

3. Configured a Heroku server and deployed my Django applications.
